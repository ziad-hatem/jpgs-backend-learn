welcome_description: |-
  A very warm welcome to Jeddah Prep and Grammar School (JPGS). Since opening in 1967, we are proud to be one of the first schools in Saudi Arabia to offer a traditional British education, blending academic rigor with a commitment to personal growth and development.
  As Headmaster, I am excited to lead a school that is built on a foundation of high academic standards. Our curriculum challenges students to excel and fosters a deep love for learning. We believe that every student has the potential to achieve greatness, and we are committed to providing a supportive environment where each individual can thrive.
  Our school is not just an academic institution; it is a community school where every child is visible and valued. We celebrate diversity, encourage collaboration, and create opportunities for every student to succeedâ€”no matter their background or abilities. We are proud of our vibrant school community, which is centred on mutual respect and inclusion.
  Many of our students receive university offers from some of the best institutions in the UK, US, and Canada. This speaks to the calibre of education we provide and the dedication of our students and staff. As JPGS continues to grow, our goal remains the same: to provide a comprehensive and innovative education that equips our students with the skills they need for success in an ever-changing world.
  At the core of our values is curiosity and innovation, as we encourage students to explore their passions and think critically about the world around them. We also emphasize cultural dexterity, collaboration, and communication, helping our students build the interpersonal and leadership skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.
  We are deeply committed to ensuring the security, safety, and happiness of every student, fostering a learning environment that is not only enriching but also supportive and caring.
  Thank you for visiting our website, and for being a part of our journey. I look forward to all the great things we will continue to achieve together!
